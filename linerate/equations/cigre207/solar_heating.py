    r"""Compute the direct solar radiation.

    Equation (10-11) on page 19 of :cite:p:`cigre601`. Equation (10) states that the direct solar
    radiation on a surface normal to the solar beam at sea level, :math:`I_{B(0)}`, is given by

    .. math::

        N_s \frac{1280 \sin(H_s)}{\sin(H_s) + 0.314},

    where :math:`N_s` is the clearness ratio which is used to adjust the amount of radiation
    compared to what goes through a standard Indian atmosphere, and :math:`H_s` is the solar
    altitude.

    While the solar radiation model is based on :cite:p:`sharma1965interrelationships` and
    therefore have parameters estimated for an Indian atmosphere, it gives comparable results to
    the solar radiation model in the IEEE standard :cite:p:`ieee738`. It is therefore reasonable to
    assume that the parameters work in other climates as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sin_solar_altitude:
        :math:`\sin\left(H_s\right)`. The sine of the solar altitude.
    clearness_ratio:
        :math:`N_s`. The clearness ratio (or clearness number in
        :cite:p:`sharma1965interrelationships,cigre207`).
    height_above_sea_level:
        :math:`y~\left[\text{m}\right]`. The conductor's altitude.

    Returns
    -------
    Union[float, float64, ndarray[Any, dtype[float64]]]
        :math:`I_B~\left[\text{W}~\text{m}^{-2}\right]`. The direct solar radiation.

    Note
    ----
    The 1280 originates and 0.314 in the above equation originates from
    :cite:p:`sharma1965interrelationships`, which is cited in :cite:p:`morgan1982thermal` (which is
    listed as the reference in :cite:p:`cigre601`). In :cite:p:`sharma1965interrelationships` the
    empirical relationship

        I_{B(0)} = \frac{1.842 \sin(H_s)}{\sin(H_s) + 0.3135}~\text{Ly}~\text{min}^{-1}

    is introduced, and by converting from Langley per minute to :math:`\text{W}~\text{m}^{-2}`, we
    obtain

    .. math::

        I_{B(0)} = N_s \frac{1284.488 \sin(H_s)}{\sin(H_s) + 0.3135}~\text{W}~\text{m}^{-2},

    which is equal to the equation we use (with three significant digits).

    Equation (13) on page 20 of :cite:p:`cigre601`.

    This equation differ from :cite:p:`cigre207`, however the difference is small, and the
    diffuse radiation is a small contributor to the overall solar radiation, so the total
    discrepancy between the models is small.

    Parameters

    where :math:`\eta` is the incidence angle of the sun on the line, :math:`H_s` is the solar
    altitude and :math:`F` is the ground albedo (amount of radiation diffusely reflected from the
    ground). The factor :math:`0.5 \pi` is due the assumption that the ground reflects light
    diffusely and uniformly in all directions, so the reflected energy is always directed normally
    to the line. In CIGRE207, it is also assumed that the diffuse radiation is uniformly directed,
    which leads to :math:`I_d (0.5 \pi + 0.5 F \pi)` instead of  :math:`I_d (1 + 0.5 F \pi)`
